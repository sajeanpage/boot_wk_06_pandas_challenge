# Pandas Challenge

In this challenge I was asked to use Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to create a report that includes the following data:
- District Summary
- School Summary
- Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Math Scores by Grade
- Reading Scores by Grade
- Scores by School Spending
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- Scores by School Size
- Scores by School Type
  
## Summary observations from the analyzed data: 
 - Charter schools outperformed District schools yielding higher scores and passing percentages in all measured areas on average. 
 - Large schools (2500+) underperformed all other school size categories yielding lower scores and passing percentages in all measured areas on average. 
 - Schools that spent $625 per student or greater underperformed schools that did not, yielding lower scores and passing percentages in all measured areas on average.
